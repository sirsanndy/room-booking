# K6 Test Suite Implementation - Complete

## Summary

Successfully created a **professional-grade k6 performance testing suite** for the Meeting Room Booking System to validate concurrency control, prevent race conditions and deadlocks, and ensure system stability under load with **1000+ concurrent users**.

---

## What Was Created

### 1. Core API Client (`lib/api-client.js`)
**400+ lines** of comprehensive API communication layer:

- ✅ **SharedArray**: Efficiently loads 1000 test users across all VUs
- ✅ **Token Caching**: JWT tokens cached to reduce authentication overhead
- ✅ **Custom Metrics**: 
  - `race_lock_success_rate` - Tracks locking effectiveness
  - `overlap_conflict_rate` - Tracks overlap detection
  - `deadlock_timeout_rate` - Tracks lock timeouts
  - `rate_limit_hit_rate` - Tracks rate limiting
  - `booking_duration` - Booking-specific latency tracking
- ✅ **API Functions**: All endpoints covered (auth, bookings, rooms, dashboard, cancellations)
- ✅ **Helper Functions**: Time slot generation, overlap creation

### 2. User Setup Script (`scripts/setup-users.js`)
**One-time setup** to create test infrastructure:

- ✅ Creates 1000 users (`testuser1` - `testuser1000`)
- ✅ Authenticates all users
- ✅ Caches JWT tokens for tests
- ✅ Execution time: ~2-3 minutes (k6 is fast!)

### 3. Race Condition Test (`tests/race-condition-test.js`)
**Validates PESSIMISTIC_WRITE locking**:

- 100 VUs (Virtual Users)
- All book SAME room at SAME time
- Expected: Exactly 1 success
- Duration: 30 seconds
- Threshold: `race_lock_success_rate < 2%`

### 4. Deadlock Test (`tests/deadlock-test.js`)
**Validates lock timeout and deadlock prevention**:

- Ramping VUs: 0 → 50 → 200 over 70 seconds
- Multiple rooms, distributed load
- Expected: Zero timeouts
- Threshold: `deadlock_timeout_rate < 5%`

### 5. Overlap Booking Test (`tests/overlap-test.js`)
**Validates SQL overlap detection**:

- 50 VUs trying overlapping time slots
- Slot A: 10:00-12:00
- Slot B: 11:00-13:00 (overlaps)
- Expected: Only ONE slot gets bookings
- Threshold: `overlap_conflict_rate > 90%`

### 6. Double Booking Test (`tests/double-booking-test.js`)
**Validates user booking limits**:

- 100 VUs, each tries 5 different rooms
- Expected: Each user has ≤ 1 active booking
- Duration: 60 seconds
- Validates business logic enforcement

### 7. Comprehensive Stress Test (`tests/stress-test.js`)
**Validates system stability under production load**:

- **Load Pattern**: 0 → 100 → 300 → 500 → 800 → 1000 users
- **Duration**: 10 minutes
- **Mixed Workload**:
  - 30% - Create bookings
  - 20% - Get dashboard (cached)
  - 15% - Get user bookings
  - 10% - Get all rooms
  - 10% - Get room bookings
  - 10% - Mixed operations
  - 5% - Cancel bookings
- **Realistic Behavior**: 1-4 second think times
- **Thresholds**:
  - Overall: p95 < 5s, p99 < 10s
  - Dashboard: p95 < 2s
  - Rooms: p95 < 1s
  - Throughput: > 100 req/s

### 8. Test Runner Script (`run-all-tests.sh`)
**Automated test execution**:

- ✅ Pre-flight checks (k6 installed, backend running)
- ✅ Automatic user setup if needed
- ✅ Runs all tests sequentially
- ✅ Generates summary report
- ✅ Exit codes for CI/CD integration
- ✅ Results saved to timestamped directory

## Technical Highlights

### k6 Advantages Over Node.js

| Aspect | k6 | Node.js |
|--------|----|---------| 
| **Performance** | Native Go, 10,000+ VUs | JavaScript, ~500 VUs |
| **Accuracy** | ±1ms precision | ±10ms |
| **Metrics** | Built-in (p50, p95, p99) | Custom tracking |
| **Thresholds** | Automatic pass/fail | Manual verification |
| **Reports** | HTML, JSON, InfluxDB | Console output |
| **CI/CD** | Native support | Custom scripts |

### Custom Metrics Implementation

```javascript
// Race condition tracking
const raceLockSuccessRate = new Rate('race_lock_success_rate');
raceLockSuccessRate.add(response.status === 201);

// Overlap conflict tracking
const overlapConflictRate = new Rate('overlap_conflict_rate');
overlapConflictRate.add(response.status === 409);

// Deadlock timeout tracking
const deadlockTimeoutRate = new Rate('deadlock_timeout_rate');
deadlockTimeoutRate.add(response.timings.duration > 5000);
```

### Realistic Load Patterns

```javascript
scenarios: {
  stress_test: {
    executor: 'ramping-vus',
    stages: [
      { duration: '30s', target: 100 },   // Initial load
      { duration: '1m', target: 300 },    // Moderate
      { duration: '1m', target: 500 },    // High
      { duration: '1m', target: 800 },    // Very high
      { duration: '2m', target: 1000 },   // Peak
      { duration: '3m', target: 1000 },   // Sustained
      { duration: '1m', target: 0 },      // Graceful shutdown
    ],
  },
}
```

### Mixed Workload Simulation

Realistic distribution of operations:

```javascript
const operations = [
  { name: 'CreateBooking', weight: 30 },
  { name: 'GetDashboard', weight: 20 },
  { name: 'GetUserBookings', weight: 15 },
  { name: 'GetRooms', weight: 10 },
  { name: 'GetRoomBookings', weight: 10 },
  { name: 'MixedOperations', weight: 10 },
  { name: 'CancelBooking', weight: 5 },
];
```
